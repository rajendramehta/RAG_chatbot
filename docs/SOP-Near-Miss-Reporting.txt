Standard Operating Procedure: Near Miss Reporting

All crew members are required to report any near miss incidents immediately to ensure preventative measures can be taken. A near miss is defined as an unplanned event that did not result in injury, illness, or damage - but had the potential to do so.

The procedure is as follows:
1.  Verbally report the near miss to the on-duty supervisor as soon as it is safe to do so.
2.  Within 24 hours, fill out the digital Near Miss Report Form (Form #NMR-001).
3.  The form must include a detailed description of the event, the location, the time, and any personnel involved.
4.  Submitted reports cannot be deleted, but they can be amended by a regional manager if new information becomes available. The original report will always be kept for auditing purposes.
